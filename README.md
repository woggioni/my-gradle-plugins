## Overview
This plugin will add 2 new tasks to your gradle projects

### The *exportDependencies* task
The `exportDependencies` task will simply create a `.dot` file that contains your project's dependency graph,
this task does not depend on anything and will succeed even if you don't have 
[Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) installed.

### The *renderDependencies* task
This task will invoke the `exportDependencies` task and then call Graphviz to create an visual 
representation of your dependency graph. Since this task invokes `Graphviz` directly, 
having it installed and available in your `PATH` is a requirement. 

## Install the plugin

Checkout this project and in the root folder run
```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
to install it to your local machine's Maven repository.

## Add the plugin to your project

Add this plugin to you project simply adding it to your projects `build.gradle`
```groovy
plugins {
    id "net.woggioni.plugins.dependency-export" version "0.1"
}
```

or to your `build.gradle.kts` if you prefer the Gradle Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("net.woggioni.plugins.dependency-export") version "0.1"
}
```

You can also enable it globally on your machine just create a `~/.gradle/init.gradle` file with this content

```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "net.woggioni.plugins:dependency-export:0.1"
    }
}

allprojects {
    apply plugin: net.woggioni.plugins.DependencyExportPlugin
}
```

this means that the plugin will be automatically enabled for all your Gradle projects, 
note that it doesn't alter the build process in any way except for creating the
 `renderDependency` and `exportDependencies` tasks, so it's relatively safe to do so.

If you need more information, the `sample` folder contains a basic Gradle project using the plugin,
 using both Groovy and Kotlin DSL.
 
## Configure the plugin

This is the default configuration for both tasks using Groovy DSL

```groovy
exportDependencies {
    configurationName = 'default'
    outputFile = 'dependencies.dot'
}

renderDependencies {
    format = 'xlib'
    outputFile = 'renderedDependencies'
    graphvizExecutable = 'graphviz'
}
```

and using Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
import net.woggioni.plugins.ExportDependenciesPluginExtension
import net.woggioni.plugins.RenderDependenciesPluginExtension

configure<ExportDependenciesPluginExtension> {
    configurationName = "default"
    outputFile = "dependencies.dot"
}

configure<RenderDependenciesPluginExtension> {
    format = "xlib"
    outputFile = "renderedDependencies"
    graphvizExecutable = "graphviz"
}
```

any configuration parameter can be overridden in your `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`) file
or using its correspondent Gradle's [project properties](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:project_properties).
For example to override the output format of the `renderDependencies` task from the CLI:  

```bash
gradle -PrenderDependencies.format=svg renderDependencies
```

### Parameter description

- `exportDependencies.configurationName` will select the Gradle's configuration 
(that word you put in the `dependencies` section of your build before `groupId:artifactId:versionId` tuple)
 that will be represented in the graph
- `exportDependencies.outputFile` will specify the location of the generated `.dot` file 
(note that if a relative path is provided, it will be interpreted as relative to the project's build directory)
- `renderDependencies.format` will specify the format of the file generated by Graphviz. 
The default output format is `xlib` which, on a linux machine with a GUI, will open 
a window with an interactive (with zoom and pan) view of your dependencies (this is a special format that
 will not output any file). Otherwise you can choose between any other output format supported by Graphviz, 
 refer to [its official documentation](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/output.html) for more details.
- `renderDependencies.outputFile` will specify the location of the generated file (note that if a 
relative path is provided, it will be interpreted as relative to the project's build directory)
- `renderDependencies.graphvizExecutable` will set the executable that will be launched to invoke
Graphviz so that, if you have it installed in an exotic location outside of your `PATH` or, for
 any reason, you renamed it in some way, you can configure it here.

## And finally use it!

Just run

```bash
gradle exportDependencies
```

or

```bash
gradle renderDependencies
```

and enjoy the mess of your horrible dependency thornbush. 
Now ask yourself if you really need that neural network framework for
